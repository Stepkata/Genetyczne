# GENETHIC ALGORITHM FOR SIMPLE LANGUAGE
Project made for AGH genetic programming course.
The main goal of the project is to thoroughly understand the mechanics of genetic algorithms and attempt to create the best possible implementation of the algorithm for a specific language. The project involves creating a system composed of the following components:

- A simple programming language that allows for the implementation of basic operations.
- An interpreter for this language.
- A genetic algorithm that generates programs in this language.
- A series of tests for the genetic algorithm.
